# Create and Repair Employee (Nurse) Shift Schedule
Building a schedule for employees can be an extremely complex optimization problem in which managers must balance employee preferences against scheduling requirements. In this project, we use a CSP model to model the problem and a new CSP solver to optimize over these competing scheduling and preference needs.

Employee shift scheduling is currently supporting 3/4 shifts a day. Both predictive and reactive scheduling are available.
