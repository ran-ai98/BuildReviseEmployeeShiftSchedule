# Build and Revise Employee (Nurse) Shift Schedules 
# 创建和动态修订员工（护士）轮班时间表

Building a schedule for employees can be an extremely complex optimization problem in which managers must balance employee preferences against scheduling requirements. In this project, we use a CSP model to model the problem and a new CSP solver to optimize over these competing scheduling and preference needs.

Employee shift scheduling is currently supporting 3/4 shifts a day. Both predictive and reactive scheduling are available.
