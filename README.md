# Build and Dynamically Revise Employee Shift Schedules 
# 创建和动态修订员工轮班时间表

Building a schedule for employees can be an extremely complex optimization problem in which managers must balance employee preferences against scheduling requirements. In this project, we use a CSP model and solver to model and solve the problem which smartly optimize over the competing scheduling and preference needs.

Employee shift scheduling is currently supporting 3/4 shifts per day. Both predictive and reactive scheduling are available.
